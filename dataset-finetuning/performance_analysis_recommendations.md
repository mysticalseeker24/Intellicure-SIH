# NAMASTE ↔ ICD-11 Terminology Service: Performance Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The NAMASTE terminology service has been successfully implemented with fine-tuned EmbeddingGemma model and FAISS vector search. However, model performance metrics indicate significant room for improvement in semantic matching accuracy.

## Current Performance Status

### ✅ **Successfully Completed Components**
- **Data Processing**: 20,000 → 1,546 deduplicated high-quality pairs
- **Model Training**: EmbeddingGemma fine-tuned with MultipleNegativesRankingLoss
- **FAISS Index**: 79 unique ICD entries indexed with HNSW (M=32, efConstruction=200)
- **Search Performance**: 33.8ms average query time (target: <50ms) ✅
- **Infrastructure**: Complete evaluation and testing pipeline

### ⚠️ **Performance Concerns**

#### Model Accuracy (Below Targets)

Precision@1      0.015       0.200          >0.60     ❌ FAIL
Precision@3      0.046       0.535          >0.80     ❌ FAIL

```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Training Data Quality Issues**
- **Limited Scale**: Only 1,546 training pairs after deduplication
- **Domain Gap**: Medical terminology requires specialized understanding
- **Multilingual Complexity**: Sanskrit/Hindi → English → ICD-11 mapping challenges

### 2. **Model Architecture Limitations**
- **Base Model**: EmbeddingGemma-300m may lack medical domain knowledge
- **Training Strategy**: Standard MultipleNegativesRankingLoss might not capture medical concept relationships
- **Context Window**: May not fully capture complex medical descriptions

### 3. **Evaluation Set Discrepancy**
- **Holdout Performance**: 20% P@1 vs 1.5% on test set suggests overfitting or data distribution issues
- **Semantic Misalignment**: Model may have learned surface-level patterns rather than deep medical semantics

## Improvement Recommendations

### 🎯 **Immediate Actions (High Impact, Low Effort)**

#### 1. **Enhanced Data Augmentation**
```python
# Implement synonym expansion and paraphrasing
- Add medical synonym dictionaries (Ayurveda ↔ Modern)
- Generate paraphrased descriptions using GPT/Claude
- Create negative sampling from related but different conditions
```

#### 2. **Improved Training Strategy**
```python
# Multi-stage training approach
Stage 1: Medical domain adaptation (general medical corpus)
Stage 2: NAMASTE-ICD fine-tuning (current approach)
Stage 3: Hard negative mining (misclassified examples)
```

#### 3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
```python
# Suggested improvements
- Increase training epochs: 5 → 10-15
- Reduce learning rate: 2e-5 → 1e-5
- Implement warm-up schedule
- Add weight decay for regularization
```

### 🔬 **Medium-term Improvements (Moderate Effort)**

#### 1. **Model Architecture Enhancement**
- **Larger Base Model**: Upgrade to EmbeddingGemma-2B or medical-specialized models
- **Domain Adaptation**: Pre-train on PubMed/medical literature before NAMASTE fine-tuning
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combine multiple models for robustness

#### 2. **Advanced Training Techniques**
```python
# Implement curriculum learning
- Start with high-confidence pairs (mapping_confidence > 0.8)
- Gradually introduce more challenging examples
- Use confidence-weighted loss functions
```

#### 3. **Evaluation Framework Enhancement**
```python
# Multi-dimensional evaluation
- Semantic similarity assessment (human evaluation)
- Medical expert validation of top-K results
- Cross-lingual consistency checks
```

### 🚀 **Long-term Strategies (High Impact, High Effort)**

#### 1. **Data Expansion**
- **Medical Literature Mining**: Extract NAMASTE terms from Ayurvedic texts
- **Expert Curation**: Medical professional validation of mappings
- **Cross-system Validation**: Compare with other traditional medicine taxonomies

#### 2. **Multi-modal Approach**
```python
# Integrate additional signals
- Symptom descriptions and patient presentations
- Anatomical and physiological system mappings
- Treatment methodology similarities
```

#### 3. **Active Learning Pipeline**
```python
# Continuous improvement cycle
- Deploy model to identify low-confidence predictions
- Route to medical experts for validation
- Retrain with validated examples
- Monitor performance drift
```

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Re-train with optimized parameters
2. **Data Augmentation**: Implement synonym expansion
3. **Hard Negative Mining**: Identify and retrain on misclassified examples

### Priority 2: Substantial Improvements (1-2 months)
1. **Model Upgrade**: Test larger models (EmbeddingGemma-2B, BiomedBERT)
2. **Curriculum Learning**: Implement confidence-based training progression
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple model predictions

### Priority 3: Research & Development (3-6 months)
1. **Medical Domain Adaptation**: Large-scale pre-training on medical corpora
2. **Expert Validation System**: Build human-in-the-loop evaluation pipeline
3. **Cross-lingual Consistency**: Ensure multilingual semantic preservation

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Performance Targets (Revised)
